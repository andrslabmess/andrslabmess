## Ahoj! 

Welcome to Andrs Lab mess!

 .... let's call is how it is ... We all have been there ... over and over .... There are many intructions and tutorials "How to ..." properly write down notes in labook, do not forget precisely label everything and create deitailed protocols for future generations of scientis. But one day, when we decided to clean up, put all protocols in to folders and make sure, everything is on its place .... and lost track, where everything is! <br>
.... Andrs Lab mess is here for these rare occasions .... :paperclip: <br>

We both recive main training in molecular biology in Bartek's group [Institute of Molecular Genetics
of the Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.img.cas.cz/en/); (currently [Zdenƒõk Hodn√Ω group](https://www.img.cas.cz/skupina/zdenek-hodny), [Jana Dobrovoln√° subgroup](https://www.img.cas.cz/group/libor-macurek/) ) and so shared protocols are mainly based on protocols and training there, amended with some furhter information. <br>
